## Description

- This digital marketing site has been edited to meet accessibility standards. When editing this site, five issues were addressed as stated below:

### The Title Element: ![Title Element](assets/images/title-element.png)
The title element in the head of the HTML file was changed from "website" to "Horiseon Digital Marketing" to improve SEO.

### Accessibility:
- Detailed alt descriptions were added to all images that appear on the website.

### HTML Semantics:
- Sections previously marked as "div" were renamed to define their appropriate function on the page. 

- The navigation within the header was renamed "nav". All the links on the nav bar relocate the user to their respective sections within the page.

- The sidebar was renamed "aside" and the contents within were renamed "article."

- The main section of the website was renamed "main", and the content enclosed were renamed to "section."

- Headers < h1 > through < h4 > were organcized in descending order on the HTML page.

### CSS Changes:
- CSS elements were rearranged to match the order they appear in the HTML file.
- Styling content for the three sections under main were consolidated and renamed "notecard" due to the notecard-type styling of the sections.
